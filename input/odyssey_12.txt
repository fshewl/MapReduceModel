 Ithaca. When seen from the top of
Mt. Eryx Marettimo shows as it should do according to "Od." ix. 25,26,
"on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the West," while
the other islands lie "some way off it to the East." As we descend
to Trapani, Marettimo appears to sink on to the top of the island of
Levanzo, behind which it disappears. My friend, the late Signor E.
Biaggini, pointed to it once as it was just standing on the top of
Levanzo, and said to me "Come cavalca bene" ("How well it rides"), and
this immediately suggested my emendation to me. Later on I found in
the hymn to the Pythian Apollo (which abounds with tags taken from the
"Odyssey") a line ending [Greek] which strengthened my suspicion that
this was the original ending of the second of the two lines above under
consideration.

{49} See note on line 3 of this book. The reader will observe that
the writer has been unable to keep the women out of an interpolation
consisting only of four lines.

{50} Scheria means a piece of land jutting out into the sea. In my
"Authoress of the Odyssey" I thought "Jutland" would be a suitable
translation, but it has been pointed out to me that "Jutland" only means
the land of the Jutes.

{51} Irrigation as here described is common in gardens near Trapani. The
water that supplies the ducts is drawn from wells by a mule who turns a
wheel with buckets on it.

{52} There is not a word here about the cattle of the sun-god.

{53} The writer evidently thought that green, growing wood might also be
well seasoned.

{54} The reader will note that the river was flowing with salt water
i.e. that it was tidal.

{55} Then the Ogygian island was not so far off, but that Nausicaa might
be assumed to know where it was.

{56} Greek [Greek]

{57} I suspect a family joke, or sly allusion to some thing of which
we know nothing, in this story of Eurymedusa's having been brought from
Apeira. The Greek word "apeiros" means "inexperienced," "ignorant." Is
it possible that Eurymedusa was notoriously incompetent?

{58} Polyphemus was also son to Neptune, see "Od." ix. 412,529. he was
therefore half brother to Nausithous, half uncle to King Alcinous, and
half great uncle to Nausicaa.

{59} It would seem as though the writer thought that Marathon was close
to Athens.

{60} Here the writer, knowing that she is drawing (with embellishments)
from things actually existing, becomes impatient of past tenses and
slides into the present.

{61} This is hidden malice, implying that the Phaeacian magnates were
no better than they should be. The final drink-offering should have been
made to Jove or Neptune, not to the god of thievishness and rascality
of all kinds. In line 164 we do indeed find Echeneus proposing that
a drink-offering should be made to Jove, but Mercury is evidently,
according to our authoress, the god who was most likely to be of use to
them.

{62} The fact of Alcinous knowing anything about the Cyclopes suggests
that in the writer's mind Scheria and the country of the Cyclopes were
not very far from one another. I take the Cyclopes and the giants to be
one and the same people.

{63} "My property, etc." The authoress is here adopting an Iliadic line
(xix. 333), and this must account for the absence of all reference
to Penelope. If she had happened to remember "Il." v.213, she would
doubtless have appropriated it by preference, for that line reads "my
country, my wife, and all the greatness of my house."

{64} The at first inexplicable sleep of Ulysses (bk. xiii. 79, etc.)
is here, as also in viii. 445, being obviously prepared. The writer
evidently attached the utmost importance to it. Those who know that the
harbour which did duty with the writer of the "Odyssey" for the one in
which Ulysses landed in Ithaca, was only about 2 miles from the place
in which Ulysses is now talking with Alcinous, will understand why the
sleep was so necessary.

{65} There were two classes--the lower who were found in provisions
which they had to cook for themselves in the yards and outer precincts,
where they would also eat--and the upper who would eat in the cloisters
of the inner court, and have their cooking done for them.

{66} Translation very dubious. I suppose the [Greek] here to be the
covered sheds that ran round the outer courtyard. See illustrations at
the end of bk. iii.

{67} The writer apparently deems that the words "as compared with what
oxen can plough in the same time" go without saying. Not so the writer
of the "Iliad" from which the Odyssean passage is probably taken. He
explains that mules can plough quicker than oxen ("Il." x.351-353)

{68} It was very fortunate that such a disc happened to be there, seeing
that none like it were in common use.

{69} "Il." xiii. 37. Here, as so often elsewhere in the "Odyssey," the
appropriation of an Iliadic line which is not quite appropriate puzzles
the reader. The "they" is not the chains, nor yet Mars and Venus. It is
an overflow from the Iliadic passage in which Neptune hobbles his horses
in bonds "which none could either unloose or break so that they might
stay there in that place." If the line would have scanned without the
addition of the words "so that they might stay there in that place,"
they would have been omitted in the "Odyssey."

{70} The reader will note that Alcinous never goes beyond saying that
he is going to give the goblet; he never gives it. Elsewhere in both
"Iliad" and "Odyssey" the offer of a present is immediately followed by
the statement that it was given and received gladly--Alcinous actually
does give a chest and a cloak and shirt--probably also some of the corn
and wine for the long two-mile voyage was provided by him--but it is
quite plain that he gave no talent and no cup.

{71} "Il." xviii, 344-349. These lines in the "Iliad" tell of the
preparation for washing the body of Patroclus, and I am not pleased that
the writer of the "Odyssey" should have adopted them here.

{72} see note {64}

{73} see note {43}

{74} The reader will find this threat fulfilled in bk. xiii

{75} If the other islands lay some distance away from Ithaca (which
the word [Greek] suggests), what becomes of the [Greek] or gut between
Ithaca and Samos which we hear of in Bks. iv. and xv.? I suspect that
the authoress in her mind makes Telemachus come back from Pylos to the
Lilybaean promontory and thence to Trapani through the strait between
the Isola Grande and the mainland--the island of Asteria being the one
on which Motya afterwards stood.

{76} "Il." xviii. 533-534. The sudden lapse into the third person here
for a couple of lines is due to the fact that the two Iliadic lines
taken are in the third person.

{77} cf. "Il." ii. 776. The words in both "Iliad" and "Odyssey" are
[Greek]. In the "Iliad" they are used of the horses of Achilles'
followers as they stood idle, "champing lotus."

{78} I take all this passage about the Cyclopes having no ships to
be sarcastic--meaning, "You people of Drepanum have no excuse for not
colonising the island of Favognana, which you could easily do, for you
have plenty of ships, and the island is a very good one." For that
the island so fully described here is the Aegadean or "goat" island of
Favognana, and that the Cyclopes are the old Sican inhabitants of Mt.
Eryx should not be doubted.

{79} For the reasons why it was necessary that the night should be so
exceptionally dark see "The Authoress of the Odyssey" pp. 188-189.

{80} None but such lambs as would suck if they were with their mothers
would be left in the yard. The older lambs should have been out feeding.
The authoress has got it all wrong, but it does not matter. See "The
Authoress of the Odyssey" p.148.

{81} This line is enclosed in brackets in the received text, and is
omitted (with note) by Messrs. Butcher & Lang. But lines enclosed in
brackets are almost always genuine; all that brackets mean is that the
bracketed passage puzzled some early editor, who nevertheless found
it too well established in the text to venture on omitting it. In the
present case the line bracketed is the very last which a full-grown male
editor would be likely to interpolate. It is safer to infer that the
writer, a young woman, not knowing or caring at which end of the ship
the rudder should be, determined to make sure by placing it at both
ends, which we shall find she presently does by repeating it (line 340)
at the stern of the ship. As for the two rocks thrown, the first I take
to be the Asinelli, see map facing p.80. The second I see as the two
contiguous islands of the Formiche, which are treated as one, see map
facing p.108. The Asinelli is an island shaped like a boat, and pointing
to the island of Favognana. I think the authoress's compatriots, who
probably did not like her much better that she did them, jeered at the
absurdity of Ulysses' conduct, and saw the Asinelli or "donkeys," not as
the rock thrown by Polyphemus, but as the boat itself containing Ulysses
and his men.

{82} This line exists in the text here but not in the corresponding
passage xii. 141. I am inclined to think it is interpolated (probably
by the poetess herself) from the first of lines xi. 115-137, which I can
hardly doubt were added by the writer when the scheme of the work was
enlarged and altered. See "The Authoress of the Odyssey" pp. 254-255.

{83} "Floating" ([Greek]) is not to be taken literally. The island
itself, as apart from its inhabitants, was quite normal. There is no
indication of its moving during the month that Ulysses stayed with
Aeolus, and on his return from his unfortunate voyage, he seems to
have found it in the same place. The [Greek] in fact should no more be
pressed than [Greek] as applied to islands, "Odyssey" xv. 299--where
they are called "flying" because the ship would fly past them. So also
the "Wanderers," as explained by Buttmann; see note on "Odyssey" xii.
57.

{84} Literally "for the ways of the night and of the day are near." I
have seen what Mr. Andrew Lang says ("Homer and the Epic," p.236, and
"Longman's Magazine" for January, 1898, p.277) about the "amber route"
and the "Sacred Way" in this connection; but until he gives his grounds
for holding that the Mediterranean peoples in the Odyssean age used to
go far North for their amber instead of getting it in Sicily, where it
is still found in considerable quantities, I do not know what weight I
ought to attach to his opinion. I have been unable to find grounds
for asserting that B.C. 1000 there was any commerce between the
Mediterranean and the "Far North," but I shall be very ready to learn
if Mr. Lang will enlighten me. See "The Authoress of the Odyssey" pp.
185-186.

{85} One would have thought that when the sun was driving the stag down
to the water, Ulysses might have observed its whereabouts.

{86} See Hobbes of Malmesbury's translation.

{87} "Il." vxiii. 349. Again the writer draws from the washing the body
of Patroclus--which offends.

{88} This visit is wholly without topographical significance.

{89} Brides presented themselves instinctively to the imagination of the
writer, as the phase of humanity which she found most interesting.

{90} Ulysses was, in fact, to become a missionary and preach Neptune to
people who knew not his name. I was fortunate enough to meet in Sicily
a woman carrying one of these winnowing shovels; it was not much shorter
than an oar, and I was able at once to see what the writer of the
"Odyssey" intended.

{91} I suppose the lines I have enclosed in brackets to have been added
by the author when she enlarged her original scheme by the addition of
books i.-iv. and xiii. (from line 187)-xxiv. The reader will observe
that in the corresponding passage (xii. 137-141) the prophecy ends with
"after losing all your comrades," and that there is no allusion to the
suitors. For fuller explanation see "The Authoress of the Odyssey" pp.
254-255.

{92} The reader will remember that we are in the first year of Ulysses'
wanderings, Telemachus therefore was only eleven years old. The same
anachronism is made later on in this book. See "The Authoress of the
Odyssey" pp. 132-133.

{93} Tradition says that she had hanged herself. Cf. "Odyssey" xv. 355,
etc.

{94} Not to be confounded with Aeolus king of the winds.

{95} Melampus, vide book xv. 223, etc.

{96} I have already said in a note on bk. xi. 186 that at this point of
Ulysses' voyage Telemachus could only be between eleven and twelve years
old.

{97} Is the writer a man or a woman?

{98} Cf. "Il." iv. 521, [Greek]. The Odyssean line reads, [Greek]. The
famous dactylism, therefore, of the Odyssean line was probably suggested
by that of the Ileadic rather than by a desire to accommodate sound to
sense. At any rate the double coincidence of a dactylic line, and an
ending [Greek], seems conclusive as to the familiarity of the writer of
the "Odyssey" with the Iliadic line.

{99} Off the coast of Sicily and South Italy, in the month of May, I
have seen men fastened half way up a boat's mast with their feet resting
on a crosspiece, just large enough to support them. From this point
of vantage they spear sword-fish. When I saw men thus employed I could
hardly doubt that the writer of the "Odyssey" had seen others like them,
and had them in her mind when describing the binding of Ulysses. I have
therefore with some diffidence ventured to depart from the received
translation of [Greek] (cf. Alcaeus frag. 18, where, however, it is
very hard to say what [Greek] means). In Sophocles' Lexicon I find a
reference to Chrysostom (l, 242, A. Ed. Benedictine Paris 1834-1839)
for the word [Greek], which is probably the same as [Greek], but I have
looked for the passage in vain.

{100} The writer is at fault here and tries to put it off on Circe. When
Ulysses comes to take the route prescribed by Circe, he ought to pass
either the Wanderers or some other difficulty of which we are not told,
but he does not do so. The Planctae, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and
Charybdis, and the alternative between them and something untold
merges into the alternative whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or
Charybdis. Yet from line 260, it seems we are to consider the Wanderers
as having been passed by Ulysses; this appears even more plainly from
xxiii. 327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions the Wandering rocks as
having been between the Sirens and Scylla and Charybdis. The writer,
however, is evidently unaware that she does not quite understand her own
story; her difficulty was perhaps due to the fact that though Trapanese
sailors had given her a fair idea as to where all her other localities
really were, no one in those days more than in our own could localise
the Planctae, which in fact, as Buttmann has argued, were derived not
from any particular spot, but from sailors' tales about the difficulties
of navigating the group of the Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on
"Od." x. 3). Still the matter of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she
would not forgo them. The whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on
Scylla suggests allusion to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is
on the Italian side, and therefore may be said to look West. It is about
8 miles thence to the Sicilian coast, so Ulysses may be perfectly well
told that after passing Scylla he will come to the Thrinacian island or
Sicily. Charybdis is transposed to a site some few miles to the north of
its actual position.

{101} I suppose this line to have been intercalated by the author when
lines 426-446 were added.

{102} For the reasons which enable us to identify the island of the two
Sirens with the Lipari island now Salinas--the ancient Didyme, or "twin"
island--see The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp. 195, 196. The two
Sirens doubtless were, as their name suggests, the whistling gusts, or
avalanches of air that at times descend without a moment's warning from
the two lofty mountains of Salinas--as also from all high points in the
neighbourhood.

{103} See Admiral Smyth on the currents in the Straits of Messina,
quoted in "The Authoress of the Odyssey," p. 197.

{104} In the islands of Favognana and Marettimo off Trapani I have seen
men fish exactly as here described. They chew bread into a paste and
throw it into the sea to attract the fish, which they then spear. No
line is used.

{105} The writer evidently regards Ulysses as on a coast that looked
East at no great distance south of the Straits of Messina somewhere,
say, near Tauromenium, now Taormina.

{106} Surely there must be a line missing here to tell us that the keel
and mast were carried down into Charybdis. Besides, the aorist [Greek]
in its present surrounding is perplexing. I have translated it as though
it were an imperfect; I see Messrs. Butcher and Lang translate it as
a pluperfect, but surely Charybdis was in the act of sucking down the
water when Ulysses arrived.

{107} I suppose the passage within brackets to have been an afterthought
but to have been written by the same hand as the rest of the poem. I
suppose xii. 103 to have been also added by the writer when she decided
on sending Ulysses back to Charybdis. The simile suggests the hand of
the wife or daughter of a magistrate who had often seen her father come
in cross and tired.

{108} Gr. [Greek]. This puts coined money out of the question, but
nevertheless implies that the gold had been worked into ornaments of
some kind.

{109} I suppose Teiresias' prophecy of bk. xi. 114-120 had made no
impression on Ulysses. More probably the prophecy was an afterthought,
intercalated, as I have already said, by the authoress when she changed
her scheme.

{110} A male writer would have made Ulysses say, not "may you give
satisfaction to your wives," but "may your wives give satisfaction to
you."

{111} See note {64}.

{112} The land was in reality the shallow inlet, now the salt works of
S. Cusumano--the neighbourhood of Trapani and Mt. Eryx being made to do
double duty, both as Scheria and Ithaca. Hence the necessity for making
Ulysses set out after dark, fall instantly into a profound sleep, and
wake up on a morning so foggy that he could not see anything till the
interviews between Neptune and Jove and between Ulysses and Minerva
should have given the audience time to accept the situation. See
illustrations and map near the end of bks. v. and vi. respectively.

{113} This cave, which is identifiable with singular completeness, is
now called the "grotta del toro," probably a corruption of "tesoro," for
it is held to contain a treasure. See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp.
167-170.

{114} Probably they would.

{115} Then it had a shallow shelving bottom.

{116} Doubtless the road would pass the harbour in Odyssean times as it
passes the salt works now; indeed, if there is to be a road at all there
is no other level ground which it could take. See map above referred to.

{117} The rock at the end of the Northern harbour of Trapani, to which
I suppose the writer of the "Odyssey" to be here referring, still bears
the name Malconsiglio--"the rock of evil counsel." There is a legend
that it was a ship of Turkish pirates who were intending to attack
Trapani, but the "Madonna di Trapani" crushed them under this rock just
as they were coming into port. My friend Cavaliere Giannitrapani of
Trapani told me that his father used to tell him when he was a boy that
if he would drop exactly three drops of oil on to the water near the
rock, he would see the ship still at the bottom. The legend is evidently
a Christianised version of the Odyssean story, while the name supplies
the additional detail that the disaster happened in consequence of an
evil counsel.

{118} It would seem then that the ship had got all the way back from
Ithaca in about a quarter of an hour.

{119} And may we not add "and also to prevent his recognising that he
was only in the place where he had met Nausicaa two days earlier."

{120} All this is to excuse the entire absence of Minerva from books
ix.-xii., which I suppose had been written already, before the authoress
had determined on making Minerva so prominent a character.

{121} We have met with this somewhat lame attempt to cover the writer's
change of scheme at the end of bk. vi.

{122} I take the following from The Authoress of the Odyssey, p. 167.
"It is clear from the text that there were two [caves] not one, but some
one has enclosed in brackets the two lines in which the second cave is
mentioned, I presume because he found himself puzzled by having a second
cave sprung upon him when up to this point he had only been told of one.

"I venture to think that if he had known the ground he would not have
been puzzled, for there are two caves, distant about 80 or 100 yards
from one another." The cave in which Ulysses hid his treasure is, as I
have already said, identifiable with singular completeness. The other
cave presents no special features, neither in the poem nor in nature.

{123} There is no attempt to disguise the fact that Penelope had long
given encouragement to the suitors. The only defence set up is that she
did not really mean to encourage them. Would it not have been wiser to
have tried a little discouragement?

{124} See map near the end of bk. vi. Ruccazzu dei corvi of course means
"the rock of the ravens." Both name and ravens still exist.

{125} See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp. 140, 141. The real reason
for sending Telemachus to Pylos and Lacedaemon was that the authoress
might get Helen of Troy into her poem. He was sent at the only point in
the story at which he could be sent, so he must have gone then or not at
all.

{126} The site I assign to Eumaeus's hut, close to the Ruccazzu dei
Corvi, is about 2,000 feet above the sea, and commands an extensive
view.

{127} Sandals such as Eumaeus was making are still worn in the Abruzzi
and elsewhere. An oblong piece of leather forms the sole: holes are cut
at the four corners, and through these holes leathern straps are passed,
which are bound round the foot and cross-gartered up the calf.

{128} See note {75}

{129} Telemachus like many another good young man seems to expect every
one to fetch and carry for him.

{130} "Il." vi. 288. The store room was fragrant because it was made of
cedar wood. See "Il." xxiv. 192.

{131} cf. "Il." vi. 289 and 293-296. The dress was kept at the bottom
of the chest as one that would only be wanted on the greatest occasions;
but surely the marriage of Hermione and of Megapenthes (bk, iv. ad
init.) might have induced Helen to wear it on the preceding evening,
in which case it could hardly have got back. We find no hint here of
Megapenthes' recent marriage.

{132} See note {83}.

{133} cf. "Od." xi. 196, etc.

{134} The names Syra and Ortygia, on which island a great part of the
Doric Syracuse was originally built, suggest that even in Odyssean times
there was a prehistoric Syracuse, the existence of which was known to
the writer of the poem.

{135} Literally "where are the turnings of the sun." Assuming, as we may
safely do, that the Syra and Ortygia of the "Odyssey" refer to Syracuse,
it is the fact that not far to the South of these places the land turns
sharply round, so that mariners following the coast would find the
sun upon the other side of their ship to that on which they'd had it
hitherto.

Mr. A. S. Griffith has kindly called my attention to Herod iv. 42,
where, speaking of the circumnavigation of Africa by Phoenician mariners
under Necos, he writes:

"On their return they declared--I for my part do not believe them, but
perhaps others may--that in sailing round Libya [i.e. Africa] they had
the sun upon their right hand. In this way was the extent of Libya first
discovered.

"I take it that Eumaeus was made to have come from Syracuse because
the writer thought she rather ought to have made something happen at
Syracuse during her account of the voyages of Ulysses. She could
not, however, break his long drift from Charybdis to the island of
Pantellaria; she therefore resolved to make it up to Syracuse in another
way."

{135} Modern excavations establish the existence of two and only two
pre-Dorian communities at Syracuse; they were, so Dr. Orsi informed me,
at Plemmirio and Cozzo Pantano. See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp.
211-213.

{136} This harbour is again evidently the harbour in which Ulysses had
landed, i.e. the harbour that is now the salt works of S. Cusumano.

{137} This never can have been anything but very niggardly pay for some
eight or nine days' service. I suppose the crew were to consider the
pleasure of having had a trip to Pylos as a set off. There is no trace
of the dinner as having been actually given, either on the following or
any other morning.

{138} No hawk can tear its prey while it is on the wing.

{139} The text is here apparently corrupt, and will not make sense as it
stands. I follow Messrs. Butcher and Lang in omitting line 101.

{140} i.e. to be milked, as in South Italian and Sicilian towns at the
present day.

{141} The butchering and making ready the carcases took place partly in
the outer yard and partly in the open part of the inner court.

{142} These words cannot mean that it would be afternoon soon after they
were spoken. Ulysses and Eumaeus reached the town which was "some way
off" (xvii. 25) in time for the suitor's early meal (xvii. 170 and 176)
say at ten or eleven o' clock. The context of the rest of the book shows
this. Eumaeus and Ulysses, therefore, cannot have started later than
eight or nine, and Eumaeus's words must be taken as an exaggeration for
the purpose of making Ulysses bestir himself.

{143} I imagine the fountain to have been somewhere about where the
church of the Madonna di Trapani now stands, and to have been fed with
water from what is now called the Fontana Diffali on Mt. Eryx.

{144} From this and other passages in the "Odyssey" it appears that
we are in an age anterior to the use of coined money--an age when
cauldrons, tripods, swords, cattle, chattels of all kinds, measures
of corn, wine, or oil, etc. etc., not to say pieces of gold, silver,
bronze, or even iron, wrought more or less, but unstamped, were the
nearest approach to a currency that had as yet been reached.

{145} Gr. is [Greek]

{146} I correct these proofs abroad and am not within reach of Hesiod,
but surely this passage suggests acquaintance with the Works and Ways,
though it by no means compels it.

{147} It would seem as though Eurynome and Euryclea were the same
person. See note {156}

{148} It is plain, therefore, that Iris was commonly accepted as the
messenger of the gods, though our authoress will never permit her to
fetch or carry for any one.

{149} i.e. the doorway leading from the inner to the outer court.

{150} Surely in this scene, again, Eurynome is in reality Euryclea. See
note {156}

{151} These, I imagine, must have been in the open part of the inner
courtyard, where the maids also stood, and threw the light of their
torches into the covered cloister that ran all round it. The smoke would
otherwise have been intolerable.

{152} Translation very uncertain; vide Liddell and Scott, under [Greek]

{153} See photo on opposite page.

{154} cf. "Il." ii. 184, and 217, 218. An additional and well-marked
feature being wanted to convince Penelope, the writer has taken the
hunched shoulders of Thersites (who is mentioned immediately after
Eurybates in the "Iliad") and put them on to Eurybates' back.

{155} This is how geese are now fed in Sicily, at any rate in summer,
when the grass is all burnt up. I have never seen them grazing.

{156} Lower down (line 143) Euryclea says it was herself that had thrown
the cloak over Ulysses--for the plural should not be taken as implying
more than one person. The writer is evidently still fluctuating between
Euryclea and Eurynome as the name for the old nurse. She probably
originally meant to call her Euryclea, but finding it not immediately
easy to make Euryclea scan in xvii. 495, she hastily called her
Eurynome, intending either to alter this name later or to change the
earlier Euryclea's into Eurynome. She then drifted in to Eurynome
as convenience further directed, still nevertheless hankering after
Euryclea, till at last she found that the path of least resistance
would lie in the direction of making Eurynome and Euryclea two persons.
Therefore in xxiii. 289-292 both Eurynome and "the nurse" (who can be
none other than Euryclea) come on together. I do not say that this is
feminine, but it is not unfeminine.

{157} See note {156}

{158} This, I take it, was immediately in front of the main entrance of
the inner courtyard into the body of the house.

{159} This is the only allusion to Sardinia in either "Iliad" or
"Odyssey."

{160} The normal translation of the Greek word would be "holding back,"
"curbing," "restraining," but I cannot think that the writer meant
this--she must have been using the word in its other sense of "having,"
"holding," "keeping," "maintaining."

{161} I have vainly tried to realise the construction of the fastening
here described.

{162} See plan of Ulysses' house in the appendix. It is evident that the
open part of the court had no flooring but the natural soil.

{163} See plan of Ulysses' house, and note {175}.

{164} i.e. the door that led into the body of the house.

{165} This was, no doubt, the little table that was set for Ulysses,
"Od." xx. 259.

Surely the difficulty of this passage has been overrated. I suppose
the iron part of the axe to have been wedged into the handle, or bound
securely to it--the handle being half buried in the ground. The axe
would be placed edgeways towards the archer, and he would have to shoot
his arrow through the hole into which the handle was fitted when the axe
was in use. Twelve axes were placed in a row all at the same height,
all exactly in front of one another, all edgeways to Ulysses whose arrow
passed through all the holes from the first onward. I cannot see how the
Greek can bear any other interpretation, the words being, [Greek]

"He did not miss a single hole from the first onwards." [Greek]
according to Liddell and Scott being "the hole for the handle of an
axe, etc.," while [Greek] ("Od." v. 236) is, according to the same
authorities, the handle itself. The feat is absurdly impossible, but our
authoress sometimes has a soul above impossibilities.

{166} The reader will note how the spoiling of good food distresses the
writer even in such a supreme moment as this.

{167} Here we have it again. Waste of substance comes first.

{168} cf. "Il." iii. 337 and three other places. It is strange that
the author of the "Iliad" should find a little horse-hair so alarming.
Possibly enough she was merely borrowing a common form line from some
earlier poet--or poetess--for this is a woman's line rather than a
man's.

{169} Or perhaps simply "window." See plan in the appendix.

{170} i.e. the pavement on which Ulysses was standing.

{171} The interpretation of lines 126-143 is most dubious, and at best
we are in a region of melodrama: cf., however, i.425, etc. from which it
appears that there was a tower in the outer court, and that Telemachus
used to sleep in it. The [Greek] I take to be a door, or trap door,
leading on to the roof above Telemachus's bed room, which we are told
was in a place that could be seen from all round--or it might be simply
a window in Telemachus's room looking out into the street. From the
top of the tower the outer world was to be told what was going on, but
people could not get in by the [Greek]: they would have to come in by
the main entrance, and Melanthius explains that the mouth of the narrow
passage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends) commanded
the only entrance by which help could come, so that there would be
nothing gained by raising an alarm. As for the [Greek] of line 143,
no commentator ancient or modern has been able to say what was
intended--but whatever they were, Melanthius could never carry twelve
shields, twelve helmets, and twelve spears. Moreover, where he could
go the others could go also. If a dozen suitors had followed Melanthius
into the house they could have attacked Ulysses in the rear, in which
case, unless Minerva had intervened promptly, the "Odyssey" would have
had a different ending. But throughout the scene we are in a region of
extravagance rather than of true fiction--it cannot be taken seriously
by any but the very serious, until we come to the episode of Phemius and
Medon, where the writer begins to be at home again.

{172} I presume it was intended that there should be a hook driven into
the bearing-post.

{173} What for?

{174} Gr: [Greek]. This is not [Greek].

{175} From lines 333 and 341 of this book, and lines 145 and 146 of bk.
xxi we can locate the approach to the [Greek] with some certainty.

{176} But in xix. 500-502 Ulysses scolded Euryclea for offering
information on this very point, and declared himself quite able to
settle it for himself.

{177} There were a hundred and eight Suitors.

{178} Lord Grimthorpe, whose understanding does not lend itself to easy
imposition, has been good enough to write to me about my conviction that
the "Odyssey" was written by a woman, and to send me remarks upon the
gross absurdity of the incident here recorded. It is plain that all
the authoress cared about was that the women should be hanged: as for
attempting to realise, or to make her readers realise, how the hanging
was done, this was of no consequence. The reader must take her word for
it and ask no questions. Lord Grimthorpe wrote:

"I had better send you my ideas about Nausicaa's hanging of the
maids (not 'maidens,' of whom Froude wrote so well in his 'Science of
History') before I forget it all. Luckily for me Liddell & Scott have
specially translated most of the doubtful words, referring to this very
place.

"A ship's cable. I don't know how big a ship she meant, but it must have
been a very small one indeed if its 'cable' could be used to tie tightly
round a woman's neck, and still more round a dozen of them 'in a row,'
besides being strong enough to hold them and pull them all up.

"A dozen average women would need the weight and strength of more than
a dozen strong heavy men even over the best pulley hung to the roof
over them; and the idea of pulling them up by a rope hung anyhow round a
pillar [Greek] is absurdly impossible; and how a dozen of them could be
hung dangling round one post is a problem which a senior wrangler would
be puzzled to answer... She had better have let Telemachus use his sword
as he had intended till she changed his mind for him."

{179} Then they had all been in Ulysses' service over twenty years;
perhaps the twelve guilty ones had been engaged more recently.

{180} Translation very doubtful--cf. "It." xxiv. 598.

{181} But why could she not at once ask to see the scar, of which
Euryclea had told her, or why could not Ulysses have shown it to her?

{182} The people of Ithaca seem to have been as fond of carping as the
Phaeacians were in vi. 273, etc.

{183} See note {156}. Ulysses's bed room does not appear to have been
upstairs, nor yet quite within the house. Is it possible that it was
"the domed room" round the outside of which the erring maids were, for
aught we have heard to the contrary, still hanging?

{184} Ulysses bedroom in the mind of the writer is here too apparently
down stairs.

{185} Penelope having been now sufficiently whitewashed, disappears from
the poem.

{186} So practised a washerwoman as our authoress doubtless knew that by
this time the web must have become such a wreck that it would have gone
to pieces in the wash.

A lady points out to me, just as these sheets are leaving my hands, that
no really good needlewoman--no one, indeed, whose work or character was
worth consideration--could have endured, no matter for what reason, the
unpicking of her day's work, day after day for between three and four
years.

{187} We must suppose Dolius not yet to know that his son Melanthius
had been tortured, mutilated, and left to die by Ulysses' orders on the
preceding day, and that his daughter Melantho had been hanged. Dolius
was probably exceptionally simple-minded, and his name was ironical.
So on Mt. Eryx I was shown a man who was always called Sonza Malizia or
"Guileless"--he being held exceptionally cunning.
